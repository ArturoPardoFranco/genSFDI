These networks are those shown in Figure 5:
    (a) Convolutional beta-VAE.
    (b) Convolutional beta-SCVAE (that is, with skip connections).
    (c) Convolutional MMD-VAE.
    (d) Convolutional MMD-SCVAE.

Each .py document can be ran as a standalone script, so you can train the model and look at its evolution for any
particular well-known dataset.

Please note that this section is not too well documented. If you wish to use these networks and have any questions,
feel free to send me a quick email! I'll try to help.
