## Description
Code for [**'Modeling and synthesis of breast cancer SFDI scatter signatures with generative models'**](https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2021.3064464) (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2021.3064464). 

## Update March 10, 2021
We are happy to anounce that the manuscript was accepted! As shown in the article, we cannot provide patient data. To compensate for that, we will prepare ad-hoc experiments for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We're currently preparing code and uploading it here, hopefully in the coming days. 

The plan is to also provide you with pre-trained models so you don't have to train them to see the results. They will not be as large as those in the article, but they should suffice to produce the same results on these tiny image datasets.

We appreciate your patience!
